================================================================================

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

1.1 High-Level Architecture Description

The Railway Parcel Management System follows a modern, scalable architecture designed to support multi-station operations with real-time communication and robust data management. The system architecture is built upon microservices principles while maintaining a cohesive, integrated user experience across all operational modules.

The high-level architecture consists of three primary layers: Presentation Layer (Frontend), Business Logic Layer (Backend), and Data Persistence Layer (Database). Each layer is designed with specific responsibilities and interfaces, enabling modular development, testing, and deployment while maintaining system integrity and performance.

The system architecture incorporates several key design principles:
- Separation of Concerns: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers
- Loose Coupling: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- High Cohesion: Related functionality is grouped within cohesive modules
