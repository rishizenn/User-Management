CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
RAILWAY PARCEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS)

================================================================================

1. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

1.1 Database Integration Issues

Challenge: Initial database connectivity problems with SQLite in Docker environment
- SQLite file permissions in containerized environment
- Database file path resolution issues
- Connection pooling configuration problems
- Data persistence across container restarts

Solution Implemented:
```javascript
// Database path resolution with fallback
const dbPath = fs.existsSync('/app/data') 
  ? path.join('/app/data', 'database.sqlite')
  : path.join(__dirname, '../database.sqlite');

// Docker volume configuration
volumes:
  - db-data:/app/data
  - uploads-data:/app/uploads

// Database initialization with retry logic
const connectDatabase = async (retries = 5) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      await sequelize.authenticate();
      console.log('Database connected successfully');
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Database connection attempt ${i + 1} failed:`, error.message);
      if (i === retries - 1) throw error;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    }
  }
};
```

1.2 API Performance Problems

Challenge: Slow API response times during peak usage
- Database query optimization issues
- N+1 query problems in parcel listing
- Large image upload processing delays
- Concurrent user handling bottlenecks

Solution Implemented:
```javascript
// Optimized database queries with eager loading
const getParcelsWithDetails = async (stationId) => {
  return await Parcel.findAll({
    where: {
      [Op.or]: [
        { sender_station_id: stationId },
        { receiver_station_id: stationId }
      ]
    },
    include: [
      { model: Station, as: 'senderStation', attributes: ['name', 'code'] },
      { model: Station, as: 'receiverStation', attributes: ['name', 'code'] }
    ],
    order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']],
    limit: 50
  });
};

// File upload optimization
app.use(fileUpload({
  limits: { fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 10MB limit
  abortOnLimit: true,
  createParentPath: true,
  useTempFiles: true,
  tempFileDir: '/tmp/'
}));
```

1.3 Frontend-Backend Synchronization

Challenge: Real-time data synchronization between frontend and backend
- State management complexity
- API polling performance issues
- Data consistency problems
- User session management

Solution Implemented:
```javascript
// Optimistic updates for better UX

  // Optimistic update
  setParcels(prev => prev.map(p => 
    p.id === parcelId ? { ...p, status: newStatus } : p
  ));
  
  try {
    const response = await api.put(`/parcels/${parcelId}/status`, { status: newStatus });
    // Confirm update
    setParcels(prev => prev.map(p => 
      p.id === parcelId ? response.data : p
    ));
  } catch (error) {
    // Revert on error
    setParcels(prev => prev.map(p => 
      p.id === parcelId ? { ...p, status: p.originalStatus } : p
    ));
    toast.error('Failed to update status');
  }
};

// API polling with exponential backoff
const useApiPolling = (endpoint, interval = 5000) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    let timeoutId;
    let retryCount = 0;
    
    const poll = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await api.get(endpoint);
        setData(response.data);
        setError(null);
        retryCount = 0;
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
        retryCount++;
      }
      
      const nextInterval = Math.min(interval * Math.pow(2, retryCount), 30000);
      timeoutId = setTimeout(poll, nextInterval);
    };
    
    poll();
    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }, [endpoint, interval]);
  
  return { data, error };
};
```

    { name: 'RapidAPI', config: rapidApiConfig }
  ];
  
  for (const service of services) {
    try {
      const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter(service.config);
      await transporter.sendMail({ to: email, subject, html });
      console.log(`Email sent via ${service.name}`);
      return { success: true, service: service.name };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`${service.name} failed:`, error.message);
      continue;
    }
  }
  
  throw new Error('All email services failed');
};

// Enhanced file upload security
const validateFileUpload = (file) => {
  const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png'];
  const maxSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
  
  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid file type. Only JPG, JPEG, PNG allowed.');
  }
  
  if (file.size > maxSize) {
    throw new Error('File size too large. Maximum 10MB allowed.');
  }
  
  // Additional security checks
  const fileName = file.name.toLowerCase();
  if (fileName.includes('..') || fileName.includes('/') || fileName.includes('\\')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid filename.');
  }
};
```

1.5 Scalability Concerns

Challenge: Ensuring system scalability for future growth
- Database performance under load
- API response time degradation
- Memory usage optimization
- Horizontal scaling preparation

Solution Implemented:
```javascript
// Database indexing strategy
CREATE INDEX idx_parcels_station_status ON parcels(sender_station_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_parcel_station ON messages(parcel_id, from_station);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_station_id ON users(station_id);

// Connection pooling configuration
const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  storage: dbPath,
  pool: {
    max: 20,
    min: 5,
    acquire: 30000,
    idle: 10000
  },
  logging: false // Disable logging in production
});

// API rate limiting
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/', apiLimiter);
```
